# Room Booking Prototype

This project is a front-end implementation of an all-in-one university room booking system. The design was thoroughly crafted, researched, and tested to suit primarily the needs of McMaster University students. This project is made in collaboration with my classmates in COMPSCI 4HC3: Human Computer Interfaces

Cloned from my groupmate's [repo](https://github.com/owengretzinger/room-booking-system)
